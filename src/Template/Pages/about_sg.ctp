                It started as an online forum initiated by Kilian Asangana and friends. In April 2008, 25 ex-students of
                SaHeCo
                met in Erlangen, Germany for the first general assembly meeting, thus laying the foundation for SHESA
                Germany
                (SG). Annual meetings have subsequently been organized since then. These meetings culminated in the
                official
                launching of SHESA Germany e.V, which took place in Essen Germany, September 2009.
